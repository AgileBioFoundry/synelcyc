;; Sample genetic-elements.dat file, created 2/13/2001 by Suzanne Paley.
;; PathoLogic v. 1.8
;; 
;; This file contains a set of records, one for each genetic element 
;; (chromosome, plasmid, etc.) or contig in the organism.  Each genetic
;; element can be described either with a single annotation file or as a set
;; of contigs (but not both).  Contigs are each described with a single
;; annotation file.  Records are ended by a single line containing only the 
;; string "//".  Each record contains a set of attribute-value pairs, one
;; per line, separated by the tab character.  Lines beginning with ; are
;; comment lines.  Valid attributes are:
;;
;; ID -- Required.  Unique identifier for the genetic element.  The identifer
;;       must be unique with respect to all other identifiers used in the
;;       PGDB, such as gene and protein identifiers.  The ID should start
;;       with an alphabetic character, and contain no spaces or special 
;;       characters. Numbers are allowed, as are dashes and underscores.
;;       Case insensitive.
;; NAME -- Required.  Descriptive name for the genetic element
;; TYPE -- Optional.  One of :CHRSM, :PLASMID, :MT (mitochondrial chromosome),
;;         :PT (chloroplast chromosome), or :CONTIG.  Defaults to :CHRSM.
;; CIRCULAR? -- Required (except for contigs).  Is the genetic element 
;;              circular?  Valid options are Y or N.
;; CODON-TABLE -- Optional, defaults to the codon table specified in the
;;                organism.dat file, or to the standard codon-table if not
;;                supplied.  This should be a number between 1 and 15.
;; ANNOT-FILE -- Required, unless the CONTIG attribute is supplied.  Filename
;;               for the annotations file for this genetic element.  The file
;;               must be in either pathologic format (.pf) or genbank 
;;               format (.gbk).  If the file is in the orgcyc/version/input/ 
;;               directory, then only the filename is required, otherwise a
;;               full pathname must be supplied.
;; SEQ-FILE -- Optional.  Filename for the sequence file for this
;;             genetic element.  The file must be in FASTA format
;;             (.fna or .fsa).  The file must be in the orgcyc/version/input/ 
;;             directory and only the filename (and not pathname) should be entered in this file.
;; CONTIG -- Optional (for all types other than :CONTIG.  This field is not
;;           permitted in records of type :CONTIG.)  ID for a contig that 
;;           forms part of this genetic element.  A genetic element may have
;;           multiple CONTIG lines.  This field should not be supplied if the
;;           ANNOT-FILE attribute is supplied.  Syntax requirements same as ID.
;;
;; Note that the "//" is required after the final genetic element, also.
