COMMON-NAME - SmtB transcriptional repressor
COMMENT - The <i>smt</i> locus of |FRAME:TAX-1140| contains a metal-regulated gene
/(|FRAME: SYNPCC7942_1290|), which encodes a class II metallothionein (MT), and a divergently
/transcribed gene, |FRAME: SYNPCC7942_1291|, which encodes a repressor of smtA transcription.
/SmtB is required for the formation of a Zn-responsive complex with the smt operator-promoter,
/and the SmtB-DNA interaction exerts metal-ion inducible negative control |CITS: [8451191]|.
/
/The |FRAME: SYNPCC7942_1291| gene has been cloned into a high expression vector and the protein
/purified to near homogeneity |CITS: [9398263]|. The protein is predominantly dimeric, and
/binds two |FRAME:ZN+2| ions per subunit with an overall Kd of 3.49 &mu;M.

COMMON-NAME - circadian period extender Pex
COMMENT - Three proteins, encoded by |FRAME: SYNPCC7942_0644| (circadian input kinase),
/|FRAME: SYNPCC7942_0624| (light-dependent period) and |FRAME: SYNPCC7942_0677|
/(period extender), affect the ability of |FRAME: TAX-1140| cells to respond to external stimuli.
/Inactivation of any of these genes results in a shortened circadian period
/|CITS: [17027373]|.
/It is believed that these three proteins form an input pathway that feeds environmental signals to the
/cyanobacterial oscilator, which is formed by the |FRAME: SYNPCC7942_1218|/
/|FRAME: SYNPCC7942_1217|/|FRAME: SYNPCC7942_1216| encoded proteins |CITS: [17804240]|.
/
/A pex mutant is unable to delay its internal oscillation when grown in a 12-h light/12-h dark
/|CITS: [16864644]|.
/The Pex protein structure includes a winged-helix domain, which is common in DNA-binding proteins,
/and Pex dimers preferentially bind to the promoter region of the |FRAME: SYNPCC7942_1218| gene
/|CITS: [17704219]|.
/This binding is thought to repress expression from the kaiA promoter because inactivation of pex results
/in kaiA levels that are higher than those in wild type |CITS: [9555901]|.

COMMON-NAME - NblR response regulator
CITATIONS - 9724820
COMMENT - The |FRAME: SYNPCC7942_2305| gene encoded a response regulator, NblR, that complements a
/cyanobacterial mutant that is unable to degrade its phycobilisome in response to nutrient deprivation.
/NblR is known to induce expression of the |FRAME: SYNPCC7942_2127| gene as well as some
/additional genes  |CITS: [16238617]|.
/
/NblR is not involved in acclimation responses that occur only during a specific nutrient limitation.
/Instead it controls at least some of the general acclimation responses that occur during any
/of a number of different stress conditions.
/Thus NblR integrates different environmental signals that link the metabolism of the cell to light
/harvesting capabilities and the activities of the photosynthetic apparatus |CITS: [9724820]|.
/
/|FRAME: SYNPCC7942_2305-MONOMER| and |FRAME: SYNPCC7942_0924-MONOMER|
/were thought to be a two-component signal transduction pathway |CITS: [16238617]|.
/However, recently it was shown that the activation of NblR is independent of phosphorylation
/by a cognate histidine kinase.  A yeast two-hybrid system revealed that the protein
/interacts with the prducts of the |FRAME: SYNPCC7942_1235| and |FRAME: SYNPCC7942_0299|
/genes, suggesting a potentially novel mechanism for its activation |CITS: [18391440]|.

COMMON-NAME - IdiB
COMMENT - IdiB (Iron deficiency-induced protein B) is a positively acting transcription factor of the idiAB
/regulon |CITS: [18424627]|. In addition, it was shown to regulate the |FRAME: SYNPCC7942_1462|-
/|FRAME: SYNPCC7942_1461| regulon, |FRAME: SYNPCC7942_1463|, |FRAME: SYNPCC7942_1607|,
/|FRAME: SYNPCC7942_2421|, |FRAME: SYNPCC7942_2079|, |FRAME: SYNPCC7942_2078|
/and |FRAME: SYNPCC7942_0650| |CITS: [18424627]|.
/
/A DNA microarray analyses performed with cells grown in the presence or absence of iron found that
/the <i>idiAB</i> region  was one of six regions of the chromosome that contain several Fe-regulated
/genes |CITS: [18424627]|. This region includes the |FRAME: SYNPCC7942_2175| gene, encoding a
/protein that modifies and protects photosystem II against selected stresses,
/|FRAME: SYNPCC7942_2174|, encoding a positively acting transcription factor of the idiAB regulon, 
/|FRAME: SYNPCC7942_2173|, encoding a protein that is believed to participate in photosynthetic cyclic
/electron transport, and |FRAME: SYNPCC7942_2172|, a gene with no known function |CITS: [18424627]|.

CITATIONS - 18312274:EV-EXP-IDA:3422213204:caspi
COMMENT - Transcription of the cmpABCD operon, encoding an |FRAME: CPLX490-3492|, is induced by
/low-|FRAME: CARBON-DIOXIDE|. The controlled induction of the cmp genes resulted in selective
/expression of high-affinity |FRAME: HCO3| transport activity. 
/The |FRAME: HCO3| transporter encoded by cmpABCD has the highest affinity among the
/|FRAME: HCO3| transporters present in the cyanobacterium |CITS: [10557362]|.
/The cmp operon activation is dependent on |FRAME: SYNPCC7942_1310-MONOMER|, a LysR family
/transcription factor of CbbR subfamily.
/CmpR was shown to bind to the regulatory region of the operon. It has been suggested that
/|FRAME: CPD-67|, which is produced by oxygenation of |FRAME: D-RIBULOSE-15-P2| by
/|FRAME: CPLX490-3496| (Rubisco) under CO2-limited conditions,
/acts as the co-inducer in the activation of the cmp operon by CmpR |CITS: [18312274]|.

TYPES - Polypeptides
COMMON-NAME - NtcA global nitrogen regulator
COMMENT - The |FRAME: SYNPCC7942_0127| gene is required for full expression of proteins subject to ammonium
/repression in the cyanobacterial genus Synechococcus.
/Sequence analysis revealed that NtcA belongs to a family of bacterial transcriptional activators that,
/among others, includes |FRAME: EG10164| and |FRAME: EG10325| from Escherichia coli
/|CITS: [1630321]|.
/
/In the absence of ammonium NtcA promotes expression of alternative nitrogen-source assimilation genes,
/such as those in the nir (nitrate assimilation) and urt (urea transport) operons, and of ammonium
/assimilation genes like amt and glnA, but can also act as a repressor of some genes.
/The NtcA binding site in DNA has the sequence signature GTAN<sub>8</sub>TAC of which the
/GTN<sub>10</sub>AC subset can be considered essential for binding.
/In the NtcA-activated promoters, the NtcA-binding site is frequently centered at about -41.5 nucleotides
/with respect to the transcription start site, and these promoters also carry a -10 box in the form
/TAN<sub>3</sub>T. This promoter structure is similar to that of the Class II promoters activated by
/CAP, but NtcA-activated promoters in which an NtcA-binding site is found further upstream from the -41.5
/position have been identified.
/
/NtcA could bind at more than one site in the regulated promoter to effect regulation of gene expression.
/This is the case, for instance, of the nir operon promoter of |FRAME: TAX-1140|, in which an NtcA-binding
/site centered at -109.5 is found in addition to the one centered at -40.5.
/
/NtcA-repressor sites are located in positions overlapping the -35 or -10 promoter boxes or the
/transcription start site |CITS: [15374662]|.
